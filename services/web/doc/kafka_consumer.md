This code is an implementation of a Kafka consumer and producer in Python using the 
confluent_kafka
 package. It subscribes to a preprocessed topic, reads messages, processes the images contained within each message in batches of 10, and publishes the results to a postprocessed topic.

The 
bytes_to_string()
 function converts encoded bytes to string format.

The code defines a few  topics: 
preprocessed
 and 
postprocessed named as example 'person', 'car', 'dog' ... This labels imported from yolo.py
. The Kafka broker configuration contains the bootstrap servers' IP address and port number.

The consumer and producer are instantiated with configurations defined separately. The consumer subscribes to the preprocessed topic.

There are several functions for decoding, decompressing, and displaying compressed image data. The 
process_images()
 function takes keys and values as inputs and returns processed images. The 
publish_message()
 function publishes the filtered images and object counts to the postprocessed topic. Finally, the 
read_and_delete_messages()
 function reads and processes the messages. The program processes images in batches of 10. If there were 10 or more images per batch, they are processed and published to the postprocessed topic.

If a keyboard interrupt occurs, the program will close.
